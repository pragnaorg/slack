					<p><b>Digital space for like minded people from K.Bitragunta and surround villages to be in touch and  help each other in a civilized, honourable terms.</b></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>As many of you know, I (Ravi Reddy) like to spend time in rural India and try to help narrow the digital divide between cities and villages in India. I am grateful for the support, in terms of advice and donations, I got from all of you for several initiatives for last 20 years.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Few of you suggested to start a WhatsApp group to stay in touch and have these discussions be more visible to larger group (Thanks Venkat Jammi for bringing this up first). I did like the idea, but I did not like WhatsApp groups and my past experience with those groups are really negative.</p> 
					<p></p>
					<p>After giving some more thought, I realized slack may be better tool and  this is my attempt to experiment  with it and see if this can help us.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Pragna?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>I (Ravi Reddy), needed a name to register slack workspace. After sleeping on the idea for few weekends, I went ahead and registered pragna.org as an internet domain and set up email address so I can cleanly start this community.</p>
					<p>I wanted to register a foundation for my education initiatives in the long run and if I succeed in my efforts I will eventually register Pragna as a foundation and continuation with it. At this point Pragna is not a registered foundation, just internet domain I am planning to use for teaching kids on how to create web sites etc.</p>
					<p>Who know how this goes, If this experiment goes well more people wants to do more together we can all make pragan big otherwise we separate our ways.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why slack? Why not WhatsApp or Facebook or another social tool?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Unlike WhatsApp groups, slack has the concept of channels. This gives flexibility for users to participate in topics they are interested in and ignore the rest. You can also control notifications and alerts really well.</p>
					<p>Slack is feature rich. You can direct messages one or more users, start channels (like groups), start conference calls with audio, video and, screen sharing, integrate with pretty much every other application in the word and great with different documents and digital formats.</p>
					<p>Slack also encourages you to create quick channels and discard them. For example, a teacher in our school can create a channel for class project and discard in a month after the project.</p>
					<p>Slack is the tool most organizations use for business now a days and learning this tool help our students and prospective job seeker a leg up during their job search and onboarding (Make a lot of our students digital savvy).</p>
					<p>There is a initial learning curve and onboarding cost, but upside to good.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do I expect after joining this community?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Primary goal is to integrate people inside our villages and ones living outside including foreign countries. Here are few examples you can start with.</p>
					<p>You will be automatically invited to #Welcome, #General channels and you will have your own space with your name under direct messages. Welcome channel will have this FAQ posted and covers discussions from new users, their issues while setting and learning slack. You can use {your name} space as a scratch pad.</p>
					<p>There channels for #schools, #temples, #random, #visiting, #jobs, #college counselling etc.  There will be sample posts in each of them channels to start with. You can join any of these channels by searching or by invitation from others.</p>
					<p>Most of these channels should be self-explanatory, but feel free to ask questions in #welcome channel if required. </p>
					<p>#visiting channel is meant for travel and sharing their experience. Any one visiting the village from outside can post content related to travel dates, details about the visit and other ways to make the trip more interesting useful.</p>
					<p>Feel free to create new channels or suggest them so someone can create them for you.</p>
